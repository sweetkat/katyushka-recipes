## Ingredients

- 500-700gr baby potatoes (gold or red potatoes), unpeeled
- 2 tsp salt
- ¼ cup chopped red onions
- ¼ cup fresh chopped parsley
- ¼ cup chopped dill
- 2 tbsp capers

#### Vinaigrette

- ⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
- 2 tsp Dijon mustard
- ½ tsp ground sumac
- ½ tsp black pepper
- ¼ tsp ground coriander

## Steps

- Wash and dry potatoes. Slice potatoes thinly using a mandoline slicer or a knife into thin circles.
- Place potatoes in a pot and add water to cover by 1 inch. Bring to a boil.
- Add salt and turn to simmer until potatoes are tender about 6 minutes or so.
- In the meantime, add vinaigrette ingredients to a small bowl and whisk until well-combined.
- Drain the potatoes and place them on a tray or baking sheet and immediately add the vinaigrette (while potatoes are warm), toss to coat.
- Let potatoes sit for 10 minutes until flavors meld.
- Add onions, fresh herbs, and capers. Toss gently to combine.
- Transfer potatoes to a serving dish or bowl. Serve at room temperature.

## Modifications

Make this mustard potato salad ahead of time. Dress the potatoes with the vinaigrette but hold the onions, herbs and capers until later. Refrigerate up to 8 hours. Before serving, add the onions, herbs and capers and toss.
Bring to room temperature before serving.
