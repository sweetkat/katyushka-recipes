## Steps

- Bake for one hour or until a cake tester or toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the center of the cake.
- Cool the cake on a wire rack before removing it from the pan.

### Optionally

- Before serving, drizzle the cake with caramel glaze.
- Or serve slices of the cake with a dessert sauce or whipped cream.

### Caramel glaze

- In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and one tablespoon evaporated milk, light cream, or milk.
- Bring to a boil, stirring, for about two minutes or until the sugar has dissolved.
- Remove the caramel mixture from the heat and drizzle over the cake.
