- 100g icing sugar
- 1 vanilla pod

### Topping

- 25g icing sugar

## Steps

- Melt the butter.
- Butter and line a 23cm loose-bottomed tin with baking parchment.
- Crush the digestive biscuits, transfer the crumbs to a bowl, then pour over the melted butter, mix thoroughly.
- Spread over the base of the tin and press firmly down into the base to create an even layer.
- Put in the fridge to chill for 1 hr.

- whisk the double cream until starting to thicken to soft peaks.
- In a separate bowl beat soft cheese, icing sugar and vanilla for 2 mins until smooth.
- Tip in the double cream and fold it into the soft cheese mix.
- Spoon onto the biscuit base, starting from the edges and working inwards, making sure that there are no air bubbles.
- Leave to set in the fridge overnight.

- Bring the cheesecake to room temperature about 30 mins before serving.

- Purée half the berries in a blender with the icing sugar and 1 tsp water, then sieve.
- Pile the remaining strawberries onto the cake, and pour the purée over the top.
