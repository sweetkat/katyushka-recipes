## Ingredients

- 150ml regular olive oil (plus more for greasing)
- 50gr cocoa powder (sifted)
- 125ml boiling water
- 200gr caster sugar
- 3 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla essence
- 150 grams ground almonds (or 125g plain flour / ¾ cup plus 1 tbps all-purpose flour)
- ½ tsp bicarb soda
- a pinch of salt

## Steps

- Grease a 22 or 23 cm/ 9inch springform tin with a little oil and line the base with baking parchment.

- In a small bowl sift the cocoa powder and whisk in the boiling water until you have a smooth, chocolatey, still runny (but only just) paste.

- Whisk in the vanilla extract, then set aside to cool a little.

- In another small bowl, combine dry ingredients the ground almonds, bicard of soda and salt.

- In a large bowl vigorously beat sugar, olive oil and eggs for about 3 minutes until you have a pale-primrose, aerated and thickened cream.

- Turn the speed down and pour in the cocoa mixture, and when mixed through, tip in the almond mixture.

- Pour the batter into the prepared tin.

- Heat your oven to 170°C/150°C. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the sides are set and the very centre, on top, still looks slightly damp. A cake tester should come up mainly clean but with a few crumbs clinging to it.

- Let it cool for 10 minutes on a wire rack, still in its tin, and then ease the sides of the cake with a small metal spatula and spring it out of the tin.

- Leave to cool completely or eat while still warm with some ice cream, as a pudding.
