## Ingredients

- 3 cups of plain flour (sifted)
- 2 egg yolks
- 250gr unsalted (softened) butter / margarine
- ¾ cup powdered or normal sugar
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp vinegar

#### Filling

- 1 can of caramel
- 150gr of softened unsalted butter

## Steps

- In a bowl add flour, 1/2 cup of sugar and softened butter (room temperature, not melted) and beat together. Ideally, you need to use a dough knife or a flat beater to mix the ingredients together.

- Take baking powder (can use a teaspoon) and pour vinegar onto it so that it starts bubbling, add it into the dough.

- In a separate bowl mix egg yolks and the remaining sugar.

- Add the eggg yolk mixture to the dough. Continue mixing until it clumps up and forms a chunky dough.

- Ready to bake: form a small ball, place in the middle of the mold and press with your thumb. The dough should cover the whole mold in a thin layer but should not go above the edges of the mold. Use a knife to shave off excess.

- Heat up oven to 180C, and bake for 10-15 mins.

- Beat caramel and butter together, and start filling the baked balls once they cool down.
